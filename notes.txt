=====================
Canvas Size : Maximum
=====================

10,000px x 10,000px seems to be max usable size with drawing and zooming working
with some frame drops, making the brush tool skip some mouse clicks. The FPS 
drops to 3-4 FPS.

I tried 20,000px x 20,000px, But Checked Background canvas is not drawing 
properly. It was taking around 30% of my 16GB RAM and hovering in the range of
80%-90% of my CPU Usage. 2 of the CPU cores were spiked at 100%

Device : Asus Laptop

==================
Draw & Logic Split
==================

Canvas, Colorbar handling has been split into two parts, Drawing and Logic 
(Input handling, major computations). Statusbar has not Logic yet. DrawToolBar
is a complicated one, most of the input handling is dependent on drawing, apart
from that, only mouse left and right clicks inputs are used, so I kept it in 
Drawing part, though shortcut handling will be handled by Logic section. In the
case of Menubar, it has the same situtation, but the clicking on menu items are
returned from Drawing section, and handled in Logic section.
