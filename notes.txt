Canvas Size : Maximum
===========

10,000px x 10,000px seems to be max usable size with drawing and zooming working
with some frame drops, making the brush tool skip some mouse clicks. The FPS 
drops to 3-4 FPS.

I tried 20,000px x 20,000px, But Checked Background canvas is not drawing 
properly. It was taking around 30% of my 16GB RAM and hovering in the range of
80%-90% of my CPU Usage. 2 of the CPU cores were spiked at 100%
